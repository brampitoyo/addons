* When a user clicks "Click to play", the copy to the left of the video thumbnail will fade away and the thumbnail will expand down and to the left.

* When a user clicks "close video" below the expanded video, the video will shrink up and to the right back to its original position. The copy to the left will fade back in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

* When a user turns on the switch, the install process begins: the switch shows download and install progress. When complete, a check mark appears in the switch.
* When a user turns off the switch, the uninstall process begins: the switch shows uninstall progress. When complete, the switch returns to original off state.
