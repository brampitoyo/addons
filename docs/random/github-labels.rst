Github labels
=============

Any repositories related to add-ons can have any labels of any format that it wants. But here's a core list of labels and colours that we'd like to have a bit of consistency. Some key labels:

* blocks release
* blocked by upstream

* good first bug
* maybe good first bug

* not ready for merge
* pull request ready

* priority one
* priority two
* triaged

Colour wise:

* red (#b60205), pay attention to these, eg: "priority one"
* green (#0e8a16), projects that we might work on, eg: "Firefox Accounts" or "signing"
* light blue (#c7def8), often left over from Bugzilla, usually and end statement eg: "invalid", "won't fix", "enhancement"
* purple (#5319e7), needs... eg: "needs ux"
* yellow (#fbca04), intermediary state eg: "maybe good first bug" or "in progress"
* blue (#0052cc), a project area at the technical level, eg: "code quality"

Other comments:

* no need to add in - or _ between words, eg "pull-request-ready" vs "pull request ready"
* you can be verbose, eg: "needs more qa" vs "qa+"
